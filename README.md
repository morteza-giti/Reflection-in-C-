# Reflection in C#
This project is a comprehensive exploration of the System.Reflection namespace in C#. The main goal is to delve into a .NET DLL file, extract its types, display their information, extract the members of each type, and invoke them using reflection. The project aims to shed light on the powerful capabilities and potential applications of reflection in the C# programming language.

# Features
- Understanding System.Reflection: Gain a deep understanding of the System.Reflection namespace and its role in providing access to metadata and the structure of assemblies at runtime.
- Type Information Extraction: Learn how to extract type information from .NET DLL files, including details about methods, properties, fields, and constructors.
- Dynamic Invocation: Explore the ability to dynamically invoke methods and members of types at runtime, providing a flexible approach to working with assemblies.
